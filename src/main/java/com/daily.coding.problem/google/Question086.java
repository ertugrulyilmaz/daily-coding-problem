/**
 * This problem was asked by Google.
 *
 * Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).
 *
 * For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them.
