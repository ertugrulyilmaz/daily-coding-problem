 * This problem was asked by Google.
 *
 * Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n,
 * and contain the following methods:
 *
 * set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item,
 * then it should also remove the least recently used item.
 * get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
 * Each operation should run in O(1) time.
