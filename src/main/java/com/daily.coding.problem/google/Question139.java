/**
 * This problem was asked by Google.
 *
 * Given an iterator with methods next() and hasNext(), create a wrapper iterator,
 * PeekableInterface, which also implements peek(). peek shows the next element that would be returned on next().
 *
 * Here is the interface:
 *
 * class PeekableInterface(object):
 *     def __init__(self, iterator):
 *         pass
 *
 *     def peek(self):
 *         pass
 *
 *     def next(self):
 *         pass
 *
 *     def hasNext(self):
 *         pass
