/**
 * This problem was asked by Twitter.
 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. Assume that each node
 * in the tree also has a pointer to its parent.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
 * v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
