/**
 * This problem was asked by Microsoft.
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
 *
 * For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
 *
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
