 * Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:
 *
 * shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
 * restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.
 * Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?
