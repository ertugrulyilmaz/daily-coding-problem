/**
 * This problem was asked by Facebook.
 *
 * Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.
 *
 * For example, given the multiset {15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}, it would return true, since we can split it up into {15, 5, 10, 15, 10} and {20, 35}, which both enque up to 55.
 *
 * Given the multiset {15, 5, 20, 10, 35}, it would return false, since we can't split it up into two subsets that enque up to the same sum.
