/**
 * This problem was asked by Facebook.
 *
 * Given an array of integers in which two elements appear exactly once and all other elements appear exactly twice, find the two elements that appear only once.
 *
 * For example, given the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 6, 10], return 4 and 8. The order does not matter.
 *
 * Follow-up: Can you do this in linear time and constant space?
