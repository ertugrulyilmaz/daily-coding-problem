/**
 * This problem was asked by Amazon.
 *
 * Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:
 *  push(item), which adds an element to the stack
 *  pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)
 * Recall that a heap has the following operations:
 * push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
 * pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap
